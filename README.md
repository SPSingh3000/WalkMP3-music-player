# WalkMP3-music-player
A music player that shows a built-in playlist made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to develop an audio player which can play the mp3 files and follow the traditional music player functionalities.

The project conains three separate files for better reading and organizing purposes:
* player.html: includes the basic skeleton structure for the music player layout.
* styles.css: includes the formatting and styling options for better visuals.
* script.js: includes the main operations such as play, pause, next or previous song and a progress bar that shows the audio progression while playing a song.
